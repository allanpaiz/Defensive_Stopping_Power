## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl (Undergraduate Track).

### Problem
The topic for the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl was: **Help evaluate tackling tactics and strategy**

I struggled to find a direction for my project, on several occasions my ideas we limited by the provided datasets.
The two main problems I faced were:
1. The `first_contact` flag in the data was misleading.
2. 2. The data lacked other information on contact between ball carriers and defender

### Solution
Stuff about the model
The project develops a contact detection model to identify interactions between the ball carrier and defenders using tracking data, then computes YAAC to quantify defensive performance post-contact.
I built a contact detection model to identify ball carrier-defender interactions, then computed the YAAC metric to measure yards gained after contactâ€”highlighting defensive gaps.

### Impact
Stuff about YAAC
Yards Allowed After Contact (YAAC) in NFL plays.

### 

This project is centered around two objectives:
- **Developing The Contact Model**: Creating a model capable of identifying contact between the ball carrier and defenders throughout a play.
- **Leveraging The Contact Model**: Utilizing this model, the paper introduces metrics such as Yards Allowed After Contact (YAAC) and Defensive Stopping Power (DSP).
